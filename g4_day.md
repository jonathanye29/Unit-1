## How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?

It was reported that the average human adult brain can hold up to 2.5 petabytes of memory capacity. 2.5 petabytes of memory storage is equivalent to 2.5 million gigabytes. The question being asked is how many 4GB USBs are needed to download the memories of an adult. With the information we currently have, 2.5 million divided by 4 is equal to 625,000. Therefore, we would need 625,000 4GB USBs to download the memories of an adult.
