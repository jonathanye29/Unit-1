# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all her transactions using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms. Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

An example of the data store is:

| Date | Description | Category | Amount  |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Sep 23 2022 | Purchased groceries | Food | 0.073 MKR |
| Sep 24 2022 | Purchased a new car | Expenses | 116.79 MKR |

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a digital ledger for a client who is struggling to keep track of her transaction history and important statistics about the cryptocurrency she is investing in. The Crypto Wallet will provide an easy and efficient way for her to keep track of her transcations and is constructed using the software Python. It will take about 35 hours to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria given.

Maker (MKR) is a smart contract platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to solve volatility issues for the crypto market. It is the basis for a new-generation blockchain-based banking system that allows for faster and simpler international payments and peer-to-peer transactions. Maker aims to unlock the potential of decentralized finance by building an inclusive platform for economic empowerment that gives everyone equal access to the global financial marketplace.
